							<h4>Front-end Engineer</h4>
							<div class="desc_box"><br><p>At Thismoment, I spend most of my time building, supporting and debugging new marketing sites for approximately 1,000 companies. I've built the occasional 'custom' sections from scratch and have modified existing code per clients requirements.</p></div>

							<h4>Previous...</h4>

							<h4>Ebay</h4>
							<div class="desc_box"><br><p>As far back as I can remember, I have always been attracted to cool sneakers. I started collecting sneakers back in 1996 and found out, a few years later, that there were more people out there like me. I've been selling sneakers for nearly 15 years on eBay and have just recently been using it as a fun way to support my hobby.</p></div>

							<h4>Mapaya</h4>
							<div class="desc_box"><br><p>A few years ago, a friend and I decided we wanted to build a newer, better version of online classifieds. After some initial paper-napkin sketches, we commissioned a team in India to help our vision come to life. Although it didn't turn out how we had hoped, it was quite a learning experience.</p></div>

							<h4>Lake Tahoe, CA <br>2010 - 2013 </h4>
							<div class="desc_box"><br><p>After having spent so much time in New York City and the surrounding areas, I needed to get back to my roots. We moved back into my parents home in Lake Tahoe in 2010 and spent a couple of years in the area.</p></div>
						</a></li>
						<li><a href="#"><img src="images/7BK.jpg" alt="img08">
							<h4>Brooklyn, NY <br>2003 - 2010</h4>
							<div class="desc_box"><br><p>Most of my family comes from Brooklyn, New York, so it came of no surprise to them when I moved there shortly after graduating from college. I moved there the day after the blackout of 2003.</p></div>
						</a></li>

							<h4>Travel</h4>
							<div class="desc_box"><br><p>All told, I've probably spent more than two years of my life on the road. Some of the more notable (backpacking) trips: 2 months in Europe in 2002. 3 months in Asia in 2010. 1 month driving across the country in 2010. 3 months throughout Africa and Europe in 2012. </p></div>

						<li><a href="#"><img src="images/13Outdoors.jpg" alt="img13">
							<h4>The Great Outdoors</h4>
							<div class="desc_box"><br><p>When I have free time I love to spend it outdoors. Camping, hiking, trail running and biking (road and mountain) are activities I love and actively pursue. I'm sure it has a lot to do with where I grew up (Lake Tahoe). I also love to play basketball. I love jogging around Lands End in the mornings. </p></div>
						</a></li>
						<li><a href="#"><img src="images/14Thrifting.jpg" alt="img14">
							<h4>Thrifting</h4>
							<div class="desc_box"><br><p>My mother and I used to spend Saturdays in Lake Tahoe going to thrift stores and garage sales. The things we'd find would never fail to surprise us. It's no wonder I still love thrifting. Plus it's another great way for me to enable my sneaker habit. </p></div>
